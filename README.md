AUTOMATAK Wiki Files
=====================
 
This the very first port of the wiki files present in the Automatak DNP3 project to the Sphinx 
documenting platform.

All the content was taken from this project https://github.com/automatak/dnp3/wiki and adapted to 
fit into the structure of the Sphinx software. 

For more information on the Sphinx project please visit: 
http://sphinx-doc.org/

To build the documentation you'll need: 

	- a working version of Sphinx. You can grab a copy from : http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html
	Just follow the installation instruction. 
	
	- after installing Sphinx just type:
		
		make html
		
		with that instruction you'll see files in the /build folder updated.
