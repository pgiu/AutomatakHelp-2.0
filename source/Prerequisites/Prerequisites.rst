## C++11

The core library written in C++, but makes use of more and more C++11 features all the time. This makes the code faster and easier to understand, but you do need a C++11 compiler.

## Boost libraries

The usage of boost has been substantially reduced from the original open source project. The main library only needs Boost::ASIO (header-only) and Boost::System (library). Follow the platforms specific directions to get Boost installed on your system. An asio-like networking api may be available in future releases of the C++ standard at which point the project may drop Boost altogether.

## Boost libraries >= version 1.50.0

This is the default. To achieve steady timer support, it uses the boost::asio::steady_timer typedef added in 1.50.0.  You don't have to do anything special to use this.

**Avoid Boost::ASIO 1.54 for Linux!!! There's a [regression](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8795) that will cause you grief**

## Boost libraries < version 1.50.0

The pre-processor directive OPENDNP3_BOOST_TIMER_PATCH must be defined to use BOOST versions prior to 1.50.0. Using autotools, this looks like:

```
$ ./configure CXXFLAGS=-DOPENDNP3_BOOST_TIMER_PATCH
```

## Platforms besides Windows and Linux

In theory, the library should work on MacOS and a host of other platforms supported by BOOST, but no one has tried it yet. Be the first!

## Java (optional)

If you want to build the java bindings shared library you need at least JDK 1.6. For either build system to find the jni headers you need to define the JAVA_HOME environment variable:

```
JAVA_HOME = <root directory of the jdk installation>
```

On windows this might be something like:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_11`

On linux this might be something like: 

`/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle`
