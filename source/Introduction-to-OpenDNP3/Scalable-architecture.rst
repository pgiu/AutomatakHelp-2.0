Scalable architecture
=====================

Many implementations of the protocol use a process (aka thread) per communication channel when connecting a master to many outstations. This type of architecture doesn't scale well. OpenDNP3 borrows a design pattern from modern web servers: a purely **_asynchronous_** programming model driven by a **_thread pool_**.

One way to understand why this is so important is to consider how your computer does work concurrently. You can only truly do as many things concurrently as you have **_threads_** or **_cores_**. Your operating system must then fake concurrency for the extra threads by multi-tasking using interrupts to force switches between them. Many active threads leads to an excess of [context switching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch) and memory usage. A more efficient methodology is to only use the number of threads that your system can actually run concurrently, aka a thread pool sized to the native concurrency of your system. The magic trick is then to NEVER BLOCK any of them so that they're all always doing useful work as fast as they can. This leads to efficient CPU utilization, lower memory usage, and lower average latency for servicing requests under load.

OpenDNP3 uses 100% non-blocking I/O under the hood. That's why it scales so well. Many systems in the industry have a hard time bringing up and maintaining more than a couple hundred socket connections. OpenDNP3 easily scales right up to the operating system limit, all while using a small amount of CPU and RAM.
