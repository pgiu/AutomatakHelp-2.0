There are currently two release branches:

1.1.x is the stable branch.

We won't be adding new features, but we will fix bugs if they are deemed critical.

2.0.x is the development branch. Changes are happening to the APIs. For a feature roadmap, 
check out the [milestones page](https://github.com/automatak/dnp3/issues/milestones).
