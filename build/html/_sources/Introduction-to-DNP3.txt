DNP3 (IEEE-1815, latest revision 2012) is a telemetry (aka SCADA) protocol. As such, it is primarily concerned with the reliable and efficient delivery of measurement data from an **_outstation_** (aka slave) in the field to a utility **_master_**. Control requests, the canonical example being the operation of circuit breaker, are occasionally made from the master to outstation by an operator or an automated process. DNP3 can do other related tasks such as time synchronization, file transfer, etc. A full copy of the IEEE standard document would be useful, but not strictly required to use this library. It is recommended that you at least scan a copy to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.
