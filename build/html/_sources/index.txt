Welcome to Automatak DNP3 Help's documentation!

There are currently two release branches:

* 1.1.x is the stable branch.

We won't be adding new features, but we will fix bugs if they are deemed critical.

* 2.0.x is the development branch. Changes are happening to the -APIs. For a feature roadmap, check out the [milestones page](https://github.com/automatak/dnp3/issues/milestones).


This is just a test, in the future, i'll be formatting the rest of the files to make them fit in the Sphinx format. For each bullet in the contents menu, a new folder is built and inside the folder we add the .rst files.
